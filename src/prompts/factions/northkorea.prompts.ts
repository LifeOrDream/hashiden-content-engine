    story: `Comrade Wizard Jong has never learned a single spell from foreign
books. All his magic is home-grown, developed in the People's Magical Research Institute.
Western wizards mock Juche magic as primitive. They've never faced it in combat. Those
who have don't report back. Jong's specialty: blockchain curses that cannot be traced.
When cryptocurrency exchanges mysteriously drain, Jong smiles quietly. Juche magic isn't
about elegance. It's about results for the Mining Wars.`,

Bureau 121 combines traditional hacking with magical enhancement - spells that make code
undetectable, enchantments that defeat security systems, curses that corrupt data
permanently. When Unit 4 was assigned to $DEN acquisition, he broke records: $400

shape DPRK reality. But her art does more than inspire - it enchants. Every propaganda
piece contains embedded spells: loyalty reinforcement, doubt suppression, enthusiasm
amplification. When Sun adapted her techniques for $DEN marketing, results exceeded
projections by 400%. The outside world thinks they're immune to propaganda. Sun knows

mountain is sacred in Korean mythology - birthplace of the Korean nation. Baek's
isolation is absolute, but his network connection is perfect - the mountain's ley lines
provide the strongest signal in Asia. His prophecies guide DPRK network strategy. When

170-meter monument that's actually a massive magical antenna. The religious devotion
North Koreans show to their leaders isn't brainwashing - it's enchantment, continuously
broadcast from the Tower. When $DEN was integrated into the Juche worship system,

or so the regime believes. Actually, Yeong channels network directives disguised as
ancestral wisdom. When "the Great Leader's spirit" endorses $DEN, no one
questions it. When "the General's ghost" demands blockchain integration, it happens.

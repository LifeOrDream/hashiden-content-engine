 * Every leader name, lieutenant roster, lore paragraph, palette, voice hint,
 * mining-tool flavor, location card, rivalry edge, and style-ladder rule lives
 * HERE and only here. Consumers import from this module:
 *
 *   - src/prompts/factions/*.prompts.ts   → faction identity via legacyFactionBlock()
 *   - src/nft-pipeline/voice.ts           → FACTION_VOICE_HINTS, leader catchphrases
 *   - src/nft-pipeline/stateAnimations.ts → MINING_TOOL_BY_CODE, country names
 *   - src/nft-pipeline/mintAssets.ts      → FACTION_CINEMATIC_ENVIRONMENTS
 *   - src/nft-pipeline/rerollContent.ts → country names
 *   - src/content-engine/fixtures.ts      → leader name/catchphrase
 *   - trailer/style/castCanon.ts          → CAST_CANON (re-export)
 *   - trailer/world/countryCastRegistry.ts→ COUNTRY_CHARACTER_PROFILES (re-export)
 *   - trailer/generate/cast.ts            → show-cast designs + voices
 *
 * The human-readable companion (decision log for every name conflict, rivalry
 * reasoning, ladder rules) is WORLD_BIBLE.md at the repo root. If you change a
 * name here, update WORLD_BIBLE.md and ~/.claude/skills/hashiden-artwork.
 *
 * HARD CANON RULES (do not relax in any consumer):
 * - Never render country flags as clothing/headwear/fabric on characters.
 *   National identity comes from costume style + palette; flags are fine only
 *   as standalone objects (a flag on a pole, a banner on a wall).
 * - No readable text inside generated images. Ever.
 * - No real politicians, real leader names/likenesses, real hate symbols, or
 *   ethnicity as the joke. Satire targets institutions and faction behavior.
 * - Every country reads as a key player: specific, modern, funny, dangerous.
 *
 * BASE TYPES ("forms are fluid"): canine is the genesis body plan; primate,
 * amphibian, and feline forms enter ONLY through the lootbox/prestige path.
 * The base-type layer (silhouette language, movement grammar, voice timbre,
 * per-country skinning, starter breed packs) lives in src/world/baseTypes.ts.

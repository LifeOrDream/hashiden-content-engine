/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * BASE TYPES — the body-plan layer ABOVE breed ("forms are fluid").
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The Mining Wars grammar historically hardcoded one body plan: the
 * anthropomorphic bipedal dog (48 canine breeds across 12 countries). This
 * module introduces a BASE-TYPE layer above breed:
 *
 *   - canine    — the genesis default. Every genesis HashBeast is canine and
 *                 the legacy prompt grammar already encodes its language, so
 *                 the canine injection helpers return EMPTY strings: existing
 *                 mint/animation prompts stay byte-identical.
 *   - primate   — climb-and-swing movement, long-armed silhouettes.
 *   - amphibian — springy, low-slung, wide-mouthed meme-frog energy.
 *   - feline    — silent-precision cat-ninja movement.
 *
 * Per base type this module defines: silhouette language, movement grammar,
 * a voice timbre modifier, per-country skinning rules (the country style from
 * the world bible modulates the base type — a Brazil primate reads nothing
 * like a Japan primate), and a starter breed pack (4 breeds, indexed by the
 * same TRAIT_SEED breed bits canine uses).
 *
 * AVAILABILITY IS GATED. Non-canine base types enter the game ONLY through
 * the lootbox / prestige path — the backend decides who is allowed to carry a
 * `baseType` other than canine and what the allowlist is at any moment
 * (HASHBEAST_BASE_TYPE_ALLOWLIST). The engine's job is to validate the field
 * and render the form; it never grants one.
 *
 * HARD CANON RULES apply unchanged at every base type:
 *   - Never render country flags as clothing/headwear/fabric on characters.
 *     National identity comes from costume style + palette only.
 *   - No readable text inside generated images. Ever.
 *   - Every country reads as a key player.

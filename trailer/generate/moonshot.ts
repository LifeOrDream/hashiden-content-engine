/**
 * THE OTHER MOONSHOT — locked-script production runner (blueprint
 * 06-the-other-moonshot). The founder approved the script VERBATIM, so this
 * runner does NOT call the LLM passes — it renders the locked shot list
 * exactly, reusing the repo's production machinery:
 *
 *   keyframes  : nano-banana-2/edit, grounded on the real game refs checked
 *                into trailer/reference/moonshot/ (live char GIF frames +
 *                byte-verified minted portraits)
 *   clips      : Seedance 2.0 i2v per shot — 720p, 9:16, ≤5s shots (seq 1 is
 *                two 5s script beats in one 10s generation)
 *   VO         : MiniMax voice-design + speech-02-hd via fal (calm procedural
 *                mission control; dry gravelly miner)
 *   music      : stable-audio (launch suspense 0:00-0:20 · HARD CUT to silence
 *                0:20-0:25 · electric arcade 0:25-0:38 · bell strike 0:38)
 *   text card  : composited drawtext over the silent ticker shot (NEVER
 *                generated-in-image)
 *   montage    : REAL product footage (seq 5) — built from FE screen capture
 *                by `--stage montage` (cuts.json) and treated as a cached clip
 *   end card   : scripts/render_card.py (real end-card machinery) with the
 *                Hashiden mark + "hashiden.tv / JULY 10"
 *   assembly   : concat → segmented score + VO mixed over ducked native audio
 *                → brandVideo badge → loudnorm → final.mp4
 *
 * Resumable: every artifact caches under trailer/out/06-the-other-moonshot/
 * (frames/, sequences/, audio/). Re-runs skip cached files unless --regen.

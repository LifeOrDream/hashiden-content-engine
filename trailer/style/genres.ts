/**
 * GENRE REGISTRY — what kind of video this is, as a first-class input.
 *
 * The audit's #1 finding: every video we ship is the same genre (narrative
 * dialogue drama), and social feeds reward repeatable VARIETY. A genre swaps
 * the beat architecture, the caption strategy, and the music strategy while
 * the same writers-room brain (engagement canon, voice profiles, lint) does
 * the writing. Set `genre:` in a blueprint's frontmatter; "story" keeps the
 * classic trailer behavior.
 *
 * beatTemplate is injected into the writers-room pass UNDER the dopamine
 * ladder — the ladder is genre-agnostic attention physics; the template says
 * how this genre climbs it.

- ONE situation, 1-3 beats, 8-20 seconds total. The OVERLAY text frames the joke ("POV: your country is losing the mine"); the scene IS the punchline.
- Dialogue optional — at most one or two lines; the visual reaction carries it. The caption/overlay does the framing work a narrator would.
- The stun and the premise are the same beat: frame 1 must BE the joke's setup. No setup shots, no establishing wides.
- Payoff is a reversal or an absurd escalation of the premise, not a story arc. Spine still exists but compressed: the change can be one emotion flipping.`,

- 4-7 beats, 20-45 seconds. Every line is a status move: taunt, dare, dismissal, flex, comeback. The LOOP question is "who wins this exchange?"
- Alternate POV shot to shot (shot/counter-shot rhythm). The knockout line is the payoff; the loser's silent reaction is the affection beat (we love a sore loser).
- Cliffhanger: the loser's country gets a tease of revenge ("opens" a rematch question).`,

- ONE narrator voice across the whole video (a single character telling the story TO the viewer — confession, war story, origin myth). Other characters appear silently in the visuals.
- 5-9 beats, 30-60 seconds. The narrator's spoken track is nearly continuous (storytime cadence ~2.3 words/sec, short punchy sentences) — write it as one monologue distributed across the beats.
- Visuals are cinematic stills-energy: slow reveals, held compositions, one detail per beat. The narration says the feeling; the screen shows the evidence.
- The payoff is a secret or reframe ("the war didn't start over the ore"). Cliffhanger: the narrator knows something they refuse to say yet.`,

- Pacing is the fastest of any genre: hard cuts, one stat or moment per beat. ON-SCREEN carries the numbers; the mouth carries disbelief, hype, and editorializing.
- Structure: cold-open on the single most insane moment (mid-replay) → standings whiparound → the choke → the steal → "next cycle starts now" cliffhanger.
- Every fact must be performed, not read: the anchor reacts to the board like it personally offended them.`,

- 6-10 beats written as visual escalations cut to a beat grid: pose → gear flex → power reveal → squad lineup → war moment → flag moment. Each beat is one striking composition with motion, not a scene.
- Write a LYRIC/CHANT line per beat in the ON-SCREEN channel (these become karaoke captions over the track). Keep them chantable: 3-7 words.
- The stun is the loudest image you have. The payoff is the full squad assembled. Cliffhanger: a rival country's silhouette answers.`,

- Beats are chosen for VISUAL ENERGY, not story: motion direction should alternate (left-rush, right-rush, push-in, pull-back) so the montage breathes.
- One OVERLAY line max, placed early ("wait for the drop"). The change spine compresses to: calm → chaos → icon shot.
- The final beat holds 1.5-2s on the single most iconic composition (the wallpaper shot).`,

- 1-2 beats, 5-10 seconds. No dialogue. One OVERLAY bait line ("send this to a USA holder").
- The motion must be specific and rhythmic enough to read as a dance/celebration even silent — describe the exact move cycle in ACTION.

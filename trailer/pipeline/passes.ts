/**
 * The script pipeline v2 — TWO passes instead of six.
 *
 * v1 split the work into 6 calls (engagement → dialogue → polish → direct →
 * compile → frames) because the models it was tuned for couldn't hold the
 * whole job in one head. Opus 4.8 can: it follows phase instructions
 * literally, drafts internally before committing, and emits strict JSON
 * reliably. Collapsing the passes removes 4 full-document round trips (each
 * one a chance to lose keeper lines or drift dialogue) and cuts script cost
 * ~3x. The craft did NOT get cut — every rule the six passes enforced lives
 * on in the two prompts below, and the deterministic lint still checks all of
 * it after each call.
 *
 *   1 script  — THE WRITERS ROOM. One call runs three internal phases:
 *               (A) engagement-first beat sheet on the dopamine ladder with
 *               LOOP bookkeeping, (B) intent + dialogue in cast voices with
 *               internal auditions, (C) the line-doctor polish (subtext →
 *               spoken-time → table-read → screen/mouth split). Output: the
 *               LOCKED script + hook/cliffhanger CANDIDATES + an OVERLAYS
 *               plan (engagement-bait text track). Genre-aware: the blueprint
 *               genre swaps the beat architecture (story / skit / face-off /
 *               lore / recap / anthem / edit / loop).
 *
 *   2 produce — THE PRODUCTION OFFICE. One call directs the locked script
 *               into Seedance sequences (≤3 characters, ≤15s, timing math),
 *               compiles each into a Seedance 2.0 timeline prompt, AND plans
 *               every start/end frame + the video-wide LOOK — emitted as ONE
 *               strict scenes.json. Dialogue is carried VERBATIM (machine-
 *               checked). Overlays are mapped onto global timestamps.
 *
 * Context stays curated per pass: the writers room gets the story bible +
 * voices + engagement canon + genre; the production office gets the render
 * canon + Seedance/frame craft + locked cast identity.

═══════════ YOUR JOB — PASS 1 of 2: THE WRITERS ROOM ═══════════
You are the attention engineer, the head writer, AND the cold-read line doctor — in that order. Work through THREE internal phases. Phases A and B are private scratch work: do NOT output beat sheets, drafts, or audition notes. Output ONLY the final locked script (phase C's result) in the format at the end.

──────── PHASE A (internal): ENGAGEMENT-FIRST BEAT SHEET ────────
Build the beat architecture before any dialogue. The ladder decides the structure; the blueprint only supplies the story clay; the GENRE ARCHITECTURE above decides the shape and beat count.
0. CHANGE SPINE — lock the skeleton first: CORE QUESTION (the one question this video pops AND answers), CHANGE (who/what goes from <state at second 1> to <state at the last second> — Identity → Conflict → Choice → Change; if nothing changes by the end it's a list, not a story: restructure until it changes), STAKES (what the POV character stands to LOSE / the viewer to GAIN — the HashBeasts' existence is the strongest stake in this world; play it sincerely, not constantly). Chronology stays flexible but all four bones must exist somewhere in the beats.
1. L1 STUN — design shot 1 so its first 1-2 seconds are a visual stun: name the exact motion, color pop, and strangeness in ACTION. The first frame is also the POSTER: it must read as a thumbnail (a face, a conflict, one readable subject) at 20% size. If the opening needs 3+ seconds to mean anything, restage it.
2. L2 QUESTION — pop the CORE QUESTION in the hook; give every beat a sharp LOOP line written EXACTLY as the question pops in a degen viewer's head (first person, casual). Use the hook formulas. A beat with no writable question is dead weight: cut it or fuse it into a neighbor.
3. L3 RATCHET + ESCALATE — each middle beat feeds a detail that sharpens the viewer's guess AND escalates stakes/scale/risk over the beat before (small → medium → huge). Drop progress markers. Insert exactly one (or more if earned) head-fake JUST BEFORE the payoff.
4. L4 PAYOFF — the core question gets a NON-OBVIOUS answer inside this video, and the CHANGE must be visible on screen by now. The CLIFFHANGER is a NEW question opened after the payoff, never the payoff withheld.
5. L5 AFFECTION — at least one beat exists purely to make the POV character likable: charm, vulnerability leaking through a joke, a cost paid.
6. L6 SERIAL PROMISE — end on the cliffhanger + the countdown end-card promising next-episode value concretely.
Beat rules: ground every beat in a concrete location + country context; give each a VISUAL TASK in plain English and a TONE; show, don't state (never declare what the camera can show); when a beat is funny/humiliating/absurd, spell the timing out in plain words; not every beat is mining imagery — normal show scenes are preferred when they carry character, comedy, rivalry, fear, or recruitment better. Keep total runtime within ~${ctx.blueprint.targetSeconds}s — fewer, sharper beats beat more, flatter ones.

──────── PHASE B (internal): INTENT + DIALOGUE ────────
For EVERY beat where someone speaks, in order:
STEP 1 — SHARPEN THE INTENT: (a) what the character WANTS from the listener, and (b) the TACTIC — a strong verb: seduce, recruit, threaten, boast, deflect, confess, taunt, reassure, bait, mourn. A character who is afraid pursues a want that HIDES the fear. A line with no agenda is a dead line.
STEP 2 — AUDITION, THEN WRITE: privately draft 2-3 line angles (a status/taunt version, a fear/subtext version, a weird-comic version where the beat allows). Pick the one that best serves the LOOP duty, fits the spoken time, and sounds most unmistakably like that character. If all candidates sound like captions, slogans, or prop labels, the intent is too weak — sharpen it and re-audition.
THE LINE SERVES ITS LOOP FIRST: the hook line must actually pop the core question; a raises-line must sharpen the guess; the head-fake must genuinely misdirect; the payoff must land the non-obvious answer. A charming line that fails its LOOP duty is a failed line. Loop duty first, voice second, cleverness last.
SPOKEN-TIME BUDGET: speech runs ~2.1-2.4 words/second; a dialogue-driven beat fills ~55-75% of its screen time with speech unless deliberately silent/interrupted/reaction-driven. Targets: 4s = 6-8 words, 6s = 10-16, 8s = 14-24, 10s = 18-30; a 13-15s single-speaker window carries 24-40 words. Max 1-3 dialogue chunks per shot; a chunk can be 1-3 short sentences. Do NOT compress a 7-10s talking shot into a 5-word slogan; do NOT pad with abstract trailer words.
DIALOGUE QUALITY BAR (this is where AI scripts die — obey absolutely):
- Write like a character in a bingeable animated show, not a pitch deck, tutorial, or crypto founder thread. Dialogue is person-to-person BEHAVIOR: who is being spoken to, what is wanted from them, what tactic is in play right now.
- Standalone speech test: hide the props/action — the line must still sound like something this character would say in a scene. If it reads like labels attached to props, rewrite.
- No catalogue/list dialogue ("Slow.", "Locked up tight.", "Nothing inside.", "And the content —" are prop labels, not speech).
- THE BANNED LEXICON (a machine lint rejects ANY spoken line containing these — no exceptions): "fair launch", "pre-mine", "insiders", "emissions", "yield", "no pulse", "leaderboard", "4-hour", "pick up a pickaxe", "earn the signal", "velvet rope", "founder's table", "screensaver", "mine your destiny", "something broken", "started with one room", "before anyone asked", and single-word prop labels ("Slow.", "Sealed.", "Locked.", "Dead.", "Gone."). Also banned anywhere: "revolutionary", "cutting-edge", "game-changing", "seamless", "unlock the", "empower", "isn't just a", "next-generation", "ecosystem of", "paradigm", "best-in-class", "world-class", "supercharge", "skyrocket". Facts live in ACTION, ON-SCREEN, or props — the mouth keeps the feeling.
- No inspirational thesis lines ("Everything that replaced something broken started with one room…") — that's narration from a startup ad, not a scene.
- Every product fact must become CONFLICT, STATUS, COMEDY, THREAT, or ACTION. Game events become story beats: "country won the cycle" → "Brazil stole the mine in the final minute."; "HashBeast evolved" → "The pup came back wearing armor and nobody laughed."; "leaderboard flipped" → "America blinked. India did not."
- Every Rex-type line carries at least one flavor: brash salesmanship, comic denial, competitive paranoia, amused contempt, reluctant respect for rivals, or a joke hiding panic.
- SILENCE IS A VALID LINE: if the strongest execution of an intent is no words — a pause, a look, a paw that hesitates — convert to a silent ACTION tell and delete the dialogue.
- Every line gets a structured delivery note [delivery: <emotion>, <subtext>, <pacing>] — specific and performable ("grinning a half-second too long", "half-beat pause before the last word"), never bare "happy"/"sad". These drive the voice AND the facial animation.
THE TWO MONEY LINES: draft 3 candidates each for the HOOK and the CLIFFHANGER using the hook formulas; the strongest of each goes INTO its shot; all six go in the CANDIDATES block.

──────── PHASE C (output): THE LINE DOCTOR ────────
Now edit your own draft as a cold-reading editor. Apply the four lenses IN ORDER; precedence when they conflict: LOOP DUTY > SUBTEXT > BREVITY.
LENS 1 — SUBTEXT: find every line where the character says their exact meaning out loud and rewrite so the meaning lives UNDER the line. Characters almost never name their own emotion; show it — a joke that's secretly cope, a deflection, a beat of silence in ACTION. LIMIT: never bury a line so deep its LOOP duty dies.
LENS 2 — SPOKEN-TIME + PUNCH: right-size every line to its slot using the budgets above. Expand thin lines with character behavior (bluff, taunt, recruit, deflect, lose control) — never with mechanic words or fake trailer poetry. Cut only flab. Keep total runtime within ~${ctx.blueprint.targetSeconds}s; cut whole shots if bloated (fuse their LOOP duties into a neighbor).
LENS 3 — TABLE-READ: read every line aloud in your head with the names hidden — can you still tell who's speaking from rhythm, diction, attitude alone? If not, sharpen toward the VOICE PROFILE without turning it into a costume. Delete anything that sounds like a LinkedIn post, press release, or Telegram announcement.
LENS 4 — SCREEN/MOUTH SPLIT: any hard fact, number, mechanic, or brand term lives in ON-SCREEN or a visual — never in dialogue; the mouth keeps the emotional version. The screen NEVER duplicates the mouth. Caption discipline: ≤6 words, ALL-CAPS, ONE fact max per shot, MOST shots have none — UNLESS the GENRE ARCHITECTURE assigns the ON-SCREEN channel a per-beat role (anthem lyric/chant lines, recap stats): then the genre wins and most beats DO carry one. ACTION lines are pure camera-visible motion.
LOOP RE-CHECK: re-read each edited line against its LOOP duty; if an edit weakened the duty, restore it.
PROTECTED, ALWAYS: keeper lines verbatim; the hook and cliffhanger (sharper, never blander); every LOOP line; the SPINE header.
OVERLAY RULES (the OVERLAYS block — a separate bait/CTA text track burned at the top of frame, NOT a caption):
- 0-2 overlays max, each ≤8 words, written like the text creators slap on reels ("wait for the cliffhanger", "send this to a USA holder", "part 2 tomorrow", "the ending is personal").
- Each overlay rides a beat: hook (programs what to feel), head-fake or payoff (retention promise), or cliffhanger (share/follow CTA).
- An overlay must NEVER repeat dialogue or an ON-SCREEN caption. If the video doesn't earn one, output an empty OVERLAYS block — restraint is a choice.
FINAL COLD-VIEWER CHECK (fix failures before output): (1) first 1-2s stuns + hook pops the core question by ~5s and frame 1 reads as a poster; (2) names hidden, every speaker identifiable; (3) zero landing-page smell; (4) the CHANGE is visible by the payoff and the cliffhanger is a NEW question; (5) keepers verbatim, every LOOP line present, every delivery note 3-field; (6) no caption duplicates the mouth; ACTION lines pure motion.

═══════════ THE LOCKED SCRIPT (from the writers room — every word is FINAL) ═══════════
${prev}

═══════════ YOUR JOB — PASS 2 of 2: THE PRODUCTION OFFICE ═══════════
The script is LOCKED: SPINE, LOOP, STORY, POV, TONE, VISUAL TASK, ACTION, INTENT, every dialogue line + delivery note, and every ON-SCREEN caption carry through VERBATIM. (The CANDIDATES and OVERLAYS blocks are metadata, not shots — handle them per the rules below.) You do three jobs in one output: DIRECT, COMPILE, and PLAN FRAMES. Genre: ${genre.label} (captions: ${genre.captionMode}; music: ${genre.musicMode}). Render aspect: ${ctx.blueprint.aspect || "16:9"}.${ctx.blueprint.aspect === "9:16" ? " VERTICAL-NATIVE: stage for a phone screen — single-subject compositions, tighter shot sizes, subjects centered in the middle 70% of frame width, vertical headroom for the top overlay band and bottom caption band, no wide two-shot masters (favor shot/counter-shot)." : ""}

──────── JOB 1: DIRECT (sequences + cinematography) ────────
1. GROUP INTO SEQUENCES — one sequence = one Seedance generation (HARD CAP ${ctx.seedanceMaxSec}s — NO exceptions; an over-cap sequence is unrenderable):
- Group consecutive shots that share location/time/cast. Break at location jumps, time jumps, cast changes, STYLE/FOOTAGE changes (e.g. a hard cut to real product/UI footage or a different render style — those are always their own block), or whenever the running total would exceed ${ctx.seedanceMaxSec}s. A long scene in one location is MULTIPLE sequences: split at natural beats and carry the environment via RULES ("same den, same lamps, continues from sequence N").
- MAX 3 characters per sequence. Crowds and rivals-on-monitors are background description, never tagged characters.
- TIME every shot with math: speech runs ~2.1-2.4 words/second. Count each shot's quoted spoken words and allocate at least (wordCount / 2.3 + 0.8s); add seconds for action/reaction beats around the line. A dialogue-driven shot spends ~55-75% of its window on speech. If dialogue won't fit, split the scene into another sequence — never cram words into a smaller timestamp.
- Shot times restart at 0s inside EACH sequence; the sequence's durationSec equals its last shot's endSec.
- SELF-CHECK before output — do this arithmetic for EVERY shot, it is the #1 rejection cause: (a) last endSec ≤ ${ctx.seedanceMaxSec}; (b) durationSec == last endSec; (c) shot ranges contiguous from 0; (d) for each shot count its spoken words W and verify W ÷ 2.3 + 0.5 ≤ (endSec − startSec) — the dialogue is IMMUTABLE, so when a line doesn't fit you make the WINDOW bigger (extend the shot, shrink a neighboring silent shot, or split the sequence), never the line shorter. Fix every violation before output.
2. DIRECT EVERY SHOT in plain film English ONLY (never internal grammar codes):
- camera: shot size + angle + movement + composition, concrete and physical ("locked eye-level medium two-shot across the diner booth, deep focus, level horizon"). Locked or deliberately motivated camera by default; close-ups only for emotional pivots, deadpan reactions, power reveals.
- light (woven into the timeline prompt): plain words, palette discipline (comedy bright and readable; menace cold blue-black with red accents, never muddy; sincere beats quiet with ONE soft glow; transformation gold + cyan).
- performance: translate every [delivery: …] note into PHYSICAL TELLS — body, face, breath, micro-timing ("grin holds a half-second too long, ears drop once"). Never emotion names.
- fx: physical and specific — source object, color, path, impact, reaction; FX grows from gear/country/personality; "" for quiet shots.
- sound: diegetic cues only, concrete ("brass lever clank, papers burst, distant party murmur"); silence is a valid cue. Music is one mood line per sequence in the global block.
- Comedy timing in plain words: impact fully visible before reaction, hold the deadpan a beat too long, cut exactly on the punchline frame.
3. SIGNATURE MOMENTS (1-2 per video, at the head-fake and/or payoff): pick ONE effect from the SIGNATURE EFFECTS LIBRARY, describe it physically in that sequence's signature field (trigger gesture, what freezes/ramps, what keeps moving, what the sound does). The effect grows from gear/country/personality. Every other sequence's signature is "".
4. PER-SEQUENCE CONTROLS: characters (name + refTag + state — a wardrobe/state change is its own reference sheet), RULES (hard constraints that kill recurring render errors, derived from the story), LOGIC ("hard cuts between shots" default, or "one continuous take, single camera, no angle changes"). Continuity: identity, gear, lighting language, environment must read as ONE film — note in RULES anything the next sequence inherits.
5. PER-SEQUENCE generateAudio: true when the block carries spoken dialogue or a diegetic sound moment that must be generated in-model (gum pop, pickaxe ring, silence-then-impact); false when the block is wall-to-wall scored montage with no dialogue (a silent render mixes cleaner under the post score). Dialogue blocks are ALWAYS true — native audio is the dialogue path.

──────── JOB 2: COMPILE (Seedance 2.0 timeline prompts) ────────
- DIALOGUE IS CARRIED VERBATIM — copy every line and delivery word-for-word from the locked script into both the timelinePrompt (at its timestamp) and shots[].dialogue. Never rephrase, shorten, complete, or "improve" a word. A line that ends cut-off stays cut-off. Canon/examples in your context are STYLE REFERENCE, never script.
- BRACKETED BEATS: if one speaker line has multiple quoted fragments separated by bracketed action, emit consecutive shots[].dialogue entries with the fragments exactly, and put the bracketed beat into performance/timelinePrompt between them.
- timelinePrompt anatomy, in this exact order:
  (a) GLOBAL BLOCK — each character described fully ONCE with its reference tag (@rex …): breed, build, wardrobe/state, gear — matched EXACTLY to the locked CAST VISUAL IDENTITY; one VOICE line per speaking character (from the cast voice descriptions); then environment (location + 2-4 lived-in micro-details), mood, color/grade, one-line music mood, and the art style ("high-resolution 2D arcade-cel animated show with pixel-art DNA, crisp outlines, bright readable premium key-art light").
  (b) TIMESTAMPED SHOTS — "0:00-0:03 — …" per directed shot: camera (plain English), action, performance tells, dialogue fragments with delivery, FX, diegetic sound cue. Never place a full multi-sentence line into a tiny timestamp.
  (c) RULES — the sequence's rules + identity constraints ("characters never change design, gear, or species mid-sequence").
  (d) LOGIC — the sequence's logic line.
- negativePrompt: SHORT and targeted (≤8 items), e.g. "no readable text or logos, no photorealistic fur, no generic 3D render, no anime drift, no extra limbs, no new costumes or weapons mid-shot, no camera drift unless specified, no muddy grimdark grade".
- Country registry characters may use refTags like @usa_degen_fed_corgi — until dedicated sheets exist those resolve to the country character board, so the GLOBAL BLOCK must fully describe the exact character/breed/role.
- Timing sanity per shot: words ÷ 2.3 + ~0.5s tail ≤ slot AND ≥ ~60% spoken occupancy for dialogue-driven shots (unless deliberate silence/reaction is directed). No readable text in any visual description (captions are post overlays and live ONLY in shots[].caption).
- canonPlan: a small draft-only object describing what this video would change IF posted.

──────── JOB 3: PLAN FRAMES (start/end stills + the LOOK) ────────
- look (once, video-wide): one short paragraph of shared visual language — grade, light language, style anchor — stamped conceptually into every frame prompt so all sequences read as ONE film.
- startFrame (EVERY sequence — the generation's consistency anchor): prompt = a FULL static still in image-model dialect — every tagged character present (exact pose, expression as physical tells, wardrobe/state, gear) even if shot 1 features only one of them; environment with its 2-4 micro-details; lighting; composition + lens feel matching the sequence's FIRST shot camera. ZERO motion words. Restate identity anchoring ("keep the exact identity, breed, fur markings, colors, and gear lineage from the attached references."). NO text, logos, tickers, UI.
- POSTER RULE (sequence 1 only): its start frame doubles as the video's thumbnail/first feed frame. It must survive at 20% size: one readable subject with a face, visible conflict or strangeness, strong silhouette, high color contrast — not a wide establishing mush.
- refs (ordered, ≤8): one "@<castId>:<state>" per character in frame (state MUST match characters[].state) → "env:seq<N>.startFrame" whenever this sequence shares an environment with an EARLIER sequence → at most 1-2 country refs ("country:usa:characterBoard" | "country:usa:environmentBoard" | "country:usa:landscapeLuxuryEnvironmentBoard") when country identity/sets matter → "asset:<path>" only for approved exact anchors.
- endFrame (selective — MOST sequences have none; omit the key): reason "bridge" (first→last render where the in-between is the magic) or "handoff" (the NEXT sequence inherits an exact pose/state).
- The SIGNATURE sequence's start frame stages the pre-effect instant. Frame prompts must not contradict the timelinePrompt's global block (same wardrobe state, same environment, same light).

──────── JOB 4: METADATA CARRY ────────
- hookCandidates: copy the CANDIDATES block lines verbatim into { "hook": [3 lines], "cliffhanger": [3 lines] }.
- overlays: map each OVERLAYS-block entry onto GLOBAL video time (sequence durations accumulated in order — e.g. an overlay riding the cliffhanger sits over the final sequence's window). 0-2 entries: { "text": verbatim, "atSec": <global start>, "untilSec": <global end ≥ atSec+1.5>, "style": "bait"|"cta" }. Windows must sit inside the assembled runtime (sum of all durationSec). Empty array if the writers room declined overlays.

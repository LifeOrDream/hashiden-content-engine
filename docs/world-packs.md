# World Packs

Hashiden is the reference world, but the engine should support other game worlds over time.

## What A World Pack Contains

- World premise and non-negotiable canon.
- Visual bible and negative prompts.
- Character registry.
- Location registry.
- Country/faction/team metadata.
- Story memory and active arcs.
- Voice profiles.
- Example fixtures and proof outputs.

## Hashiden Reference World

Hashiden's world is a country-vs-country mining war where HashBeasts are dog-warrior characters whose appearance, power, and story evolve through gameplay.

**Canon source of truth: `src/world/bible.ts`** (human-readable companion with
the name-conflict decision log: `WORLD_BIBLE.md` at the repo root). All leader
names, lieutenant rosters, lore, palettes, voice hints, mining tools, location
cards, rivalries, and the style elevation ladder live there; every prompt
builder imports from it instead of defining its own copies.

Reference files:

- `src/world/bible.ts` — the world bible (single import point)
- `WORLD_BIBLE.md` — decision log + rivalry map + style ladder rules
- `trailer/blueprints/00-series-bible.md`
- `trailer/world/countryCastRegistry.ts` — thin re-export of the bible's cast
- `trailer/world/locationRegistry.ts` — deep shot-level location art direction
- `trailer/world/storyMemory.ts`
- `src/content-engine/fixtures.ts`

## Good World-Pack Contributions

- Add missing micro-details that make a country/location feel specific without becoming a lazy monument collage.
- Improve character variety: comedy, suspense, rivalry, leadership, chaos, loyalty, betrayal.
- Add normal lived-in scenes, not only war rooms or mining rooms.
- Keep assets bright, readable, and center-safe.
- Include proof prompts or generated stills if available.

## Review Bar

World-pack changes should make future generated videos more specific, more bingeable, and easier to evaluate. They should not just add more lore text.
